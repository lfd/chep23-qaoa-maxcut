## Setup
The code was tested on the [Qaptiva 800s](https://atos.net/en/solutions/high-performance-computing-hpc/quantum-computing-qaptiva) (V1.9.1) with Python 3.9.
The Qaptiva system is required to execute the code.
Additional libraries can be installed via pip. Creating a virtual environment is recommended:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
